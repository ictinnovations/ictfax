When the duration Observable emits a\n * value or completes, the timer is disabled, and this process repeats for the\n * next source value.\n *\n * @example <caption>Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var result = clicks.throttle(ev => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link audit}\n * @see {@link debounce}\n * @see {@link delayWhen}\n * @see {@link sample}\n * @see {@link throttleTime}\n *\n * @param {function(value: T): SubscribableOrPromise} durationSelector A function\n * that receives a value from the source Observable, for computing the silencing\n * duration for each source value, returned as an Observable or a Promise.\n * @param {Object} config a configuration object to define `leading` and `trailing` behavior.
