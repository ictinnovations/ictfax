It behaves exactly the same,\n * still accepting as a first argument either a number or a Date, which control - respectively -\n * when values of source Observable should be emitted or when it should complete.\n *\n * The only difference is that it accepts a second, required parameter. This parameter\n * should be an Observable which will be subscribed when source Observable fails any timeout check.\n * So whenever regular `timeout` would emit an error, `timeoutWith` will instead start re-emitting\n * values from second Observable. Note that this fallback Observable is not checked for timeouts\n * itself, so it can emit values and complete at arbitrary points in time. From the moment of a second\n * subscription, Observable returned from `timeoutWith` simply mirrors fallback stream. When that\n * stream completes, it completes as well.\n *\n * Scheduler, which in case of `timeout` is provided as as second argument, can be still provided\n * here - as a third, optional parameter. It still is used to schedule timeout checks and -\n * as a consequence - when second Observable will be subscribed, since subscription happens\n * immediately after failing check.\n *\n * @example <caption>Add fallback observable</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n * const minutes = Rx.Observable.interval(60 * 1000);\n *\n * seconds.timeoutWith(900, minutes)\n *     .subscribe(\n *         value => console.log(value), // After 900ms, will start emitting `minutes`,\n *                                      // since first value of `seconds` will not arrive fast enough.\n *         err => console.log(err) // Would be called after 900ms in case of `timeout`,\n *                                 // but here will never be called.\n *     );\n *\n * @param {number|Date} due Number specifying period within which Observable must emit values\n *                          or Date specifying before when Observable should complete\n * @param {Observable<T>} withObservable Observable which will be subscribed if source fails timeout check.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] Scheduler controlling when timeout checks occur.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that mirrors behaviour of source or, when timeout check fails, of an Observable\n *                          passed as a second parameter.\n * @method timeoutWith\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction timeoutWith(due, withObservable, scheduler) {\n  if (scheduler === void 0) {\n    scheduler = rxjs_1.asyncScheduler;\n  }\n\n  return operators_1.timeoutWith(due, withObservable, scheduler)(this);\n}\n\nexports.timeoutWith = timeoutWith; //# sourceMappingURL=timeoutWith.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
