This operator keeps track of the most recent value from the\n * source Observable, and emits that only when `dueTime` enough time has passed\n * without any other value appearing on the source Observable. If a new value\n * appears before `dueTime` silence occurs, the previous value will be dropped\n * and will not be emitted on the output Observable.\n *\n * This is a rate-limiting operator, because it is impossible for more than one\n * value to be emitted in any time window of duration `dueTime`, but it is also\n * a delay-like operator since output emissions do not occur at the same time as\n * they did on the source Observable. Optionally takes a {@link IScheduler} for\n * managing timers.\n *\n * @example <caption>Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var result = clicks.debounceTime(1000);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link auditTime}\n * @see {@link debounce}\n * @see {@link delay}\n * @see {@link sampleTime}\n * @see {@link throttleTime}\n *\n * @param {number} dueTime The timeout duration in milliseconds (or the time\n * unit determined internally by the optional `scheduler`) for the window of\n * time required to wait for emission silence before emitting the most recent\n * source value.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=asyncScheduler] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for\n * managing the timers that handle the timeout for each value.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source\n * Observable by the specified `dueTime`, and may drop some values if they occur\n * too frequently.\n * @method debounceTime\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction debounceTime(dueTime, scheduler) {\n  if (scheduler === void 0) {\n    scheduler = rxjs_1.asyncScheduler;\n  }\n\n  return operators_1.debounceTime(dueTime, scheduler)(this);\n}\n\nexports.debounceTime = debounceTime; //# sourceMappingURL=debounceTime.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
