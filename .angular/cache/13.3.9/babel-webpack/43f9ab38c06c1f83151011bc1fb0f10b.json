As soon as the first source value arrives,\n * the timer is enabled by calling the `durationSelector` function with the\n * source value, which returns the \"duration\" Observable. When the duration\n * Observable emits a value or completes, the timer is disabled, then the most\n * recent source value is emitted on the output Observable, and this process\n * repeats for the next source value.\n *\n * @example <caption>Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var result = clicks.audit(ev => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link auditTime}\n * @see {@link debounce}\n * @see {@link delayWhen}\n * @see {@link sample}\n * @see {@link throttle}\n *\n * @param {function(value: T): SubscribableOrPromise} durationSelector A function\n * that receives a value from the source Observable, for computing the silencing\n * duration, returned as an Observable or a Promise.\n * @return {Observable<T>} An Observable that performs rate-limiting of\n * emissions from the source Observable.\n * @method audit\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction audit(durationSelector) {\n  return operators_1.audit(durationSelector)(this);\n}\n\nexports.audit = audit; //# sourceMappingURL=audit.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
