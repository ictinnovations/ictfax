When the source emits a value,\n * the `delayDurationSelector` function is called with the source value as\n * argument, and should return an Observable, called the \"duration\" Observable.\n * The source value is emitted on the output Observable only when the duration\n * Observable emits a value or completes.\n *\n * Optionally, `delayWhen` takes a second argument, `subscriptionDelay`, which\n * is an Observable. When `subscriptionDelay` emits its first value or\n * completes, the source Observable is subscribed to and starts behaving like\n * described in the previous paragraph. If `subscriptionDelay` is not provided,\n * `delayWhen` will subscribe to the source Observable as soon as the output\n * Observable is subscribed.\n *\n * @example <caption>Delay each click by a random amount of time, between 0 and 5 seconds</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var delayedClicks = clicks.delayWhen(event =>\n *   Rx.Observable.interval(Math.random() * 5000)\n * );\n * delayedClicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link debounce}\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {function(value: T): Observable} delayDurationSelector A function that\n * returns an Observable for each value emitted by the source Observable, which\n * is then used to delay the emission of that item on the output Observable\n * until the Observable returned from this function emits a value.\n * @param {Observable} subscriptionDelay An Observable that triggers the\n * subscription to the source Observable once it emits any value.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source\n * Observable by an amount of time specified by the Observable returned by\n * `delayDurationSelector`.\n * @method delayWhen\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction delayWhen(delayDurationSelector, subscriptionDelay) {\n  return operators_1.delayWhen(delayDurationSelector, subscriptionDelay)(this);\n}\n\nexports.delayWhen = delayWhen; //# sourceMappingURL=delayWhen.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
