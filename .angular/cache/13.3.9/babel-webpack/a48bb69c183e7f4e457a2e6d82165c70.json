The value is emitted only when the duration\n * Observable emits a value or completes, and if no other value was emitted on\n * the source Observable since the duration Observable was spawned. If a new\n * value appears before the duration Observable emits, the previous value will\n * be dropped and will not be emitted on the output Observable.\n *\n * Like {@link debounceTime}, this is a rate-limiting operator, and also a\n * delay-like operator since output emissions do not necessarily occur at the\n * same time as they did on the source Observable.\n *\n * @example <caption>Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks</caption>\n * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * var result = clicks.debounce(() => Rx.Observable.interval(1000));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * @see {@link audit}\n * @see {@link debounceTime}\n * @see {@link delayWhen}\n * @see {@link throttle}\n *\n * @param {function(value: T): SubscribableOrPromise} durationSelector A function\n * that receives a value from the source Observable, for computing the timeout\n * duration for each source value, returned as an Observable or a Promise.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source\n * Observable by the specified duration Observable returned by\n * `durationSelector`, and may drop some values if they occur too frequently.\n * @method debounce\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction debounce(durationSelector) {\n  return operators_1.debounce(durationSelector)(this);\n}\n\nexports.debounce = debounce; //# sourceMappingURL=debounce.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
