This function does not accept any parameters and\n * should not return anything. It will be called whenever source Observable completes, errors or is unsubscribed,\n * which makes it good candidate to perform any necessary clean up or side effects when Observable terminates,\n * no matter how or why it terminated.\n *\n * Observable returned by `finally` will simply mirror source Observable - each time it is subscribed, source\n * Observable will be subscribed underneath.\n *\n * Note that behavior of `finally` will be repeated per every subscription, so if resulting Observable has\n * many subscribers, function passed to `finally` might be potentially called multiple times.\n *\n * Remember also that `finally` differs quite a lot from passing complete or error handler to {@link subscribe}. It will\n * return an Observable which can be further chained, while `subscribe` returns Subscription, basically ending Observable\n * chain. Function passed to `finally` will be called also when consumer of resulting Observable unsubscribes from it,\n * while handlers passed to `subscribe` will not (even complete handler). But most importantly, `finally` does not start\n * an execution of source Observable, like `subscribe` does, allowing you to set up all necessary hooks before\n * passing Observable further, even without specific knowledge how or when it will be used.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Call finally after complete notification</caption>\n * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)\n * .finally(() => console.log('I was finalized!'))\n * .map(x => x * 2) // `finally` returns an Observable, so we still can chain operators.\n * .subscribe(\n *   val => console.log(val),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('I completed!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 1\n * // 2\n * // 3\n * // \"I completed!\"\n * // \"I was finalized!\"\n *\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Call finally after consumer unsubscribes</caption>\n * const o = Rx.Observable.interval(1000)\n * .finally(() => console.log('Timer stopped'));\n *\n * const subscription = o.subscribe(\n *   val => console.log(val),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('Complete!') // Will not be called, since complete handler\n * );                               // does not react to unsubscription, just to\n *                                  // complete notification sent by the Observable itself.\n *\n * setTimeout(() => subscription.unsubscribe(), 2500);\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0 after 1s\n * // 1 after 2s\n * // \"Timer stopped\" after 2.5s\n *\n * @see {@link using}\n *\n * @param {function} callback Function to be called when source terminates (completes, errors or is unsubscribed).\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that mirrors the source, but will call the specified function on termination.\n * @method finally\n * @name finally\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction _finally(callback) {\n  return operators_1.finalize(callback)(this);\n}\n\nexports._finally = _finally; //# sourceMappingURL=finally.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
