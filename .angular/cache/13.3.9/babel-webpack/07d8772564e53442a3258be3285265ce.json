It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {SchedulerLike} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\n\nfunction observeOn(scheduler, delay) {\n  if (delay === void 0) {\n    delay = 0;\n  }\n\n  return operators_1.observeOn(scheduler, delay)(this);\n}\n\nexports.observeOn = observeOn; //# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
